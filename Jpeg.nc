interface Jpeg{
	//- we do DCT on the raw image (dataIn), quantize the resulting DCT matrix,
	//  encode and reindex values of this matrix, zero run-length encode the
	//  reindexed sequence and store the resulting code at the output (dataOut)
	//- dataIn contains raw image pixels
	//- dataOut is a placeholder for the encoded image
	//- bandwidth limit specifies how much space is allocated in dataOut buffer
	//- width and height are image dimensions (ie. size of dataIn is width*height)
	//- qual specifies the quality level of the image, the smaller qual, the better
	//  the quality (but bigger space requirements), qual must be over certain
	//  level, so that quantized DCT values can be encoded in 7 bits (error won't
	//  be thrown, but the encoded image will be distorted due to overflows!!!)
	//- command returns the length of the encoded sequence, 0 means and error
	//  (probably JtegM is still busy coding previous image)
	//- dataInBufferFix is a stupid way to fix buffer when we only care about every
	//  second byte
